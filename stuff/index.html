    <h1> What is Your Favorite Thing About School? </h1>

    <p>I joined Eastside Prep in 2020 as a Freshmen and lacked lots confidence. I didn't know many people during online school, so most days I would attend school, finish my work, and then move on to my individual hobbies. During my lonely hours in quarantine,
        I learned many new skills such as how to knit, how to perform magic tricks but most notably, how to bake bread. Thanks to my prior experience as well as my EBC, I was able to strengthen my bread making skills duirng remote school. I am especially
        thankful for Ms. Hale, a teacher in the EPS community who helped me refine my bread creation techniques.</p>
