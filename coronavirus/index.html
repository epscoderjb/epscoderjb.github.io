        <h1>Feeling Stressed? Try Journaling!</h1>
        <p>The concept of journaling is severly overlooked in today’s world. With the rise of technology in the past few decades, more and more youth are struggling with issues related to mental health. Unfortunatly, these problems continue to escalate day
            by day.
        </p>
        <p>Despite advancing society and being beneficial in many aspects, technology has many detrimental effects on a developing individual, especially through overuse which is commonly seen today. It causes damage to physical heath through eye strain
            and posture, and also reduces physical activity which can cause sleeping issues.
        </p>
        <p>Initiating these bad habits as a youth will result in many long-term issues that will affect many of today’s adolescents in their adult life. The early emergence of cognitive issues such as a short attention span and stunts in mental development
            will hamper individuals later on in their lives, hindering their opportunities for success and ability to accomplish more.
