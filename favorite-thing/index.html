    <h1> What is Your Favorite Thing About School? </h1>
    <h2><b> For me, its the comminity!</b></h2>

    <p>I joined Eastside Prep in 2020 as a Freshmen and lacked lots confidence. I didn't know many people during online school, so most days I would attend school, finish my work, and then move on to my individual hobbies. During my lonely hours in quarantine,
        I learned many new skills such as how to knit, how to perform magic tricks but most notably, how to bake bread. Thanks to my prior experience as well as my EBC, I was able to strengthen my bread making skills duirng remote school. I am especially
        thankful for Ms. Hale, a teacher in the EPS community who helped me refine my bread creation techniques.</p>

    <p>In addition to the teachers, the students are a huge part of the EPS community, who opened up to me as a new student. Within the first few months of coming out of quarantine, I made quite a few new friends and I am extremely thankful for their kindness
        and acceptance. Today, I am in touch with many people who have made me feel appreciated as a person and more confident in myself. Compared to my life in remote school, my life in in-person school has gone significantly better and I am exicted
        to see how the EPS community will develop and grow in the future. I hope to help future new students feel welcome in this comminity, so they can live their high school years to the fullest. </p>
